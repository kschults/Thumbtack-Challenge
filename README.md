* There is a bit of a delay on a single tap while it waits to see if it is a double tap. It would be nice if this delay were shorter
* Needs an image to show for incorrectly flagged mines on game loss
* Timer, high scores
* Mine counter - show how many are left
* Save game state when application gets put in background
